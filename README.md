Tool Description:

Today, all the P&D team who works with TrustFiles needs to have (or make a new one) data/idocs to make all the tests or everything they need.
They need to manipulate, need to know all the structure of a document.
What is our idea?
Develop a tool that creates automatically all these documents with the needed and correct information and structure.
What is the benefit?
Consistent test and time saved!
With a lot of time saved, all the teams can develop/test faster!
This is an innovative and original idea because it will save a lot of time.
Since I've started at sovos, I've heard that is impossible to automate any process on TrustFiles... And WE MADE IT!
We've started this project to learn about Python and solve this "Time problem".
Who would benefit with this?
Everyone!
You don't need to have all the knowledge about our solution (TrustFiles). You just need to execute our program and answer the questions.
QA, Devs, BA, PO... Everyone can use it!
